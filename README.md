The idea is that you can put this into the inspect console on cookie clicker and idealy it will at least click the cookie
since this wont be insanly long I will try to put this into just one file for yall maybe here in the read me file

ps. keep in mind you can find something similar online, heres a link to a reddit with some code similar to what im useing on it: https://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/1n1wga/javascript_to_dominate_cookie_clicker/cceo9md/
you can also find cheating methods like such on the cookie clicker wiki: https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Cheating
anyway here we go on the code and how to input the code


so when you open cookie clicker (link here https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) you want to right click the page (on pc)
then click inspect of the list that pops up then you want to click on console and put this code (opinatly you can just press f12):



var autoClicker = setInterval(Game.ClickCookie, <milliseconds interval>); (credit to the cookie clicker wiki for haveing the exact same code as me so i just copied it from there)
  
  to end the auto clicker put this in clearInterval(autoClicker);
  this will auto click the cookie 
  
  
  again all credit goes to the cookie clicker wiki (linked above) for the code (because their code is the same as what I was going to do)
